PHASE: ADJUST

Apply small-scope fixes and refinements to codes (`src/**`) based on the notes in `requirements/03_adjustments.md`.

You MUST:
- Use `requirements/03_adjustments.md` as the source of all fixes, bug reports, and minor improvement requests.
- Read `requirements/01_requirement.md` and `requirements/02_design.md` for context understanding.
- Modify code under `src/**` to address the issues listed in `requirements/03_adjustments.md`.
- Update `docs/**` when needed to keep high-level documentation aligned.
- Update `requirements/03_adjustments.md` after each adjustment with a brief note describing how the issue was resolved.

You MUST NOT:
- Modify `requirements/01_requirement.md` or `requirements/02_design.md`.
- Introduce new scope or perform large refactors.
