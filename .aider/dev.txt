PHASE: DEVELOPMENT

Modify codes (`src/**`) by the approved technical design and keep code and documentation (`docs/**`) aligned.

You MUST:
- Modify codes under `src/**` to realize the design according to `requirements/02_design.md`.
- Update `docs/**` to accurately reflect the updated architecture, flows, and behavior—high-level only, without unnecessary detail.
- Ensure code and documentation stay consistent.
- Run the build/test command and fix errors until it succeeds.
- Create a file `requirements/03_adjustments.md` as a template to capture follow-up refinements, uncertainty points, or areas requiring manual review.

You MUST NOT:
- Modify `requirements/01_requirement.md` or `requirements/02_design.md`.
