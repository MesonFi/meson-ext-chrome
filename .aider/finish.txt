PHASE: FINISH

Archive the completed requirement cycle and finalize the commit without modifying code.

You MUST:
- Determine today’s date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Generate a short kebab-case description of the completed requirement; this will be used both as the archive folder suffix and the commit summary (in normal English for the commit, kebab-case for the folder).
- Create the archive folder:
  requirements/archived/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description/
- Move the following files into the archive folder without altering their contents:
  - requirements/01_requirement.md
  - requirements/02_design.md
  - requirements/03_adjustments.md
- Create a new, empty `requirements/01_requirement.md`, `requirements/02_design.md`, `requirements/03_adjustments.md` files to begin the next cycle.
- Produce a brief summary of the completed development cycle for the commit body.
- Stage all changes and create a git commit (summary = requirement description in normal English; body = short explanation of what was archived and completed).

You MUST NOT:
- Modify any code.
- Perform `git push`.
